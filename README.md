This collection of projects is a playful exploration of **JSFuck**, a technique for obfuscating JavaScript code using only six characters: `[` `]` `(` `)` `!` `+`. JSFuck takes advantage of the loose and dynamic nature of JavaScript, demonstrating that even with a minimal set of symbols, complex code can be represented.

### JSFuck

JSFuck is an esoteric programming style where the goal is to write functional and meaningful JavaScript code using only a limited set of characters. The allowed characters are:

    [ : Opening square bracket
    ] : Closing square bracket
    ( : Opening parenthesis
    ) : Closing parenthesis
    ! : Logical NOT
    + : Addition operator

Despite its limitations, JSFuck can execute any JavaScript code.
